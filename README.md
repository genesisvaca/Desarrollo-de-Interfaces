## 🎨 Interface Development [DAM]

This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and materials developed throughout the Interface Development course, part of my Multiplatform Application Development degree.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress in building user interfaces, improving usability, and applying software engineering best practices. Each folder represents one of the course units, covering both the technical and design aspects of interface development.

## 📚 Course Overview

During this course, I will be working on:

* UT0 – Introduction to User Interface Development
Understanding the fundamentals of graphical user interfaces and their role in modern applications.

* UT1 – Creating User Interfaces
Designing and implementing user interfaces using programming tools and layout managers.

* UT2 – Generating Interfaces from XML Documents
Creating structured interfaces using XML and integrating them with application logic.

* UT3 – Creating Visual Components
Developing custom and reusable visual components to enhance interactivity and design.

* UT4 – Usability
Applying usability principles to ensure accessible and user-friendly applications.

* UT5 – Graphic Interface Design
Learning visual design techniques, color theory, typography, and consistency in UI design.

* UT6 – Report Creation
Generating professional reports and summaries within applications.

* UT7 – Application Documentation
Writing technical documentation and using standard templates for software projects.

* UT8 – Application Deployment
Packaging and distributing applications, managing configuration and version control.

* UT9 – Testing
Performing functional and usability testing to ensure quality, stability, and performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Throughout the course, I will be using:

* Languages: Java, XML

* IDE Tools: Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA

* Version Control: Git & GitHub

* Design Tools: Figma, UI prototyping utilities

* Documentation & Reporting: Markdown, PDF templates

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, I aim to:

* Build and design effective user interfaces for different types of applications.

* Apply usability and accessibility standards.

* Develop modular, maintainable front-end logic and custom components.

* Create documentation and reports that meet professional standards.

* Deploy and test applications using modern tools and workflows.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository will be updated regularly with:

* Practical exercises for each unit.

* Individual and group projects.

* Documentation and reports of testing and deployment.

It serves both as a learning portfolio and a professional showcase of my progress in software interface development.
